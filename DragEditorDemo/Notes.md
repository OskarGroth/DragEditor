#  DragEditor

These are the core concepts of the Drag Editor system:

Allow the drag view and the destination drop view to be arbitrarily nested in your view hierarchy, as long as there is a DragContainerView enclosing them somewhere further up in the hierarchy.
Drag view and destination drop view does not require any knowledge about each other.
